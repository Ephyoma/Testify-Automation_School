#fun
1. JavaScript took just 10 days to develop.
2, JavaScript was not originally intended to be a serious language :It was meant to be a lightweight scripting companion to Java…but it ended up taking over the world.
3. Java and JavaScript are NOT related

They just share a name for marketing reasons.
They’re as different as car and carpet.
4. avaScript is everywhere — not just in browsers

--- You can run it on:

Servers (Node.js)

Databases (MongoDB scripts)

Mobile apps (React Native)

Desktop apps (Electron → VS Code, Slack)

Even robots & IoT devices

The JSON format was also created from JavaScript

JSON → JavaScript Object Notation
Now used everywhere — APIs, databases, configs
